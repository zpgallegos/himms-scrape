# HIMSS Web Scrape

An example web scraping project to pull all available contacts from a web search form. Initally done as a portfolio project, intended to demonstrate Python/web automation skills. Follows an actual requested freelance project that you can view [here](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01b9b115cb4d63ef6c). Done using [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) (since the page doesn't use query parameters).

View the final report [here](https://github.com/zpgallegos/himss-scrape/blob/master/himss.ipynb). The code that performed the scrape is in [himss_scrape.py](https://github.com/zpgallegos/himss-scrape/blob/master/himss_scrape.py)
